This is a repository for the EDAV final project.

The project explores the frequency, casualties and other details of the mass shooting that have occurred in the US between 2018 and 2022. The goal is to identify and calculate aggregated statistics surrounding casualties and explore if Covid has led to an increase in the number of mass shooting in the United States.
